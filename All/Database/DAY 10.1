						:- NORMALIZATION -: 
				
	IS THE CONCEPT OF MAKING DATA RELEVANT AND MAIINTAINED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE DATABASE FOLLOWING ALL THE RULES DEFINED LIKE 
	
						STRUCTURE DATABASE 
				
	
		TABLES STAGES : 
				DEFINED VARIOUS STAGES WHERE MY CURRENT TABLES IS IN 
				
					* SET OF RULES 
					* BASED ON THEM THEY DEFINIED THE TABLE STATUS 
					* TABLE STATUS  : NORMALIZATION 
					
			IF WE FOLLOW THESE 3 RULES 
						- WE CONSIDER YOUR DATABASE IS IN CERTAING NORMALIZATION FORM 
						
			NORMALIZATION : 
						1NF  - TALK ABOUT THE STAGE OF YOUR DATABASE 
						2NF
						3NF
						4NF
						5NF

DISCUSS : 
		INF : 
			1) NO DUPLICATE DATA OR REPEATING DATA IN THE TABLES 
			2) EACH COLUMN CELL MUST HAVE SINGLE VALUE
			3) THERE MUST BE A UNIQUE KEY WHICH IDETIFY EACH ROW OF THE TABLE 
				* IF USER TRY TO ACCESS A DATA BASED ON THE UNIQUE KEY 
					HE MUST RECEIVED ONLY ONE ROW FROM THE TABLE 
					
	---------------------------------------------------------------

		MARK THAT DATABASE - 1NF

		-------------- NOW WE CAN SAY THAT MY TABLES ARE IN 3NF 

------------------MOST OF THE ORGANIZATION ONLY FOLLOW 3NF FOR THIER DATABASES ....
			NON OF THE DATABASES AS OF NOW ARE IN 4 OR 5TH NF 
				
				4
				ALL THE NON KEY KEY MUST DEPEND ON PRIMARY KEY 
				
				GOING FORWARD YOU MAY END WITH 
					EACH TABLE WITH ONLY TWO COLUMNS
						1) PRIMARY KEY COLUMN 
						2) NON KEY 
					
				RDBMS : WE NEED TO FETCH DATA FROM TABLE TO REPRESENT 
						JOIN ARE MORE EXPENSIVE IN TERMS OF EXECUTION

** BOYCE - CODD NORMAL FORM (BCNF)

-	A RELATION IS IN BCNF IF AND ONLY IF EVERY DETERMINANT IS A CANDIDATE KEY 

		DETERMINANT : POSIBLE SCENARIOS TO FETCH DATA FROM THE TABLE 
		CANDIDATE KEY  : CREATE A KEY WITH MORE THEM ONE COLUMN 
		
EXAMPLE  : 

CLIENT 	INTERVIEW_DATE	INTERVIEW_TIME 	STAFF 	ROOM_NO		
WIPRO	13TH MAY 2021	10:30			SUNIL	C101
WIPRO 	13TH MAY 2021	12:00			SUNIL	C101
CYBAGE 	13TH MAY 2021	12:30			NIKHIL	C102
TCS		1ST JULY 2021	10:30			SUNIL	C102

FD1 : 
	CLIENT + INTERVIEW DATE -- > INTERVIEW TIME + STAFF + ROOM NO (PK)
	
FD2 : 
	STAFF + INTERVIEW DATE + INTERVIEW TIME (CANDIDATE KEY) ----> CLIENT
	
FD3 : 
	ROOM NO + INTERVIEW DATE + INTERVIEW TIME ----- > CLIENT + STAFF 
													(CANDIDATE KEY) 
													
FD4 : 
	STAFF + INTERVIEW DATE ----- > ROOM NO 

	IN SOME SCENARIOS : 
			DUE XYZ RESAON 
				ROOM NUMBER CHANGE 
		
	USER HAS TO UPDATE MORE THEN RECORD
		USER HAS TO UPDATE TWO RECORDS FOR THE SAME DATA 
		
		
		DIVIDE THE TABLES IN A WAY TO REMOVE CERTAIN DEPENDESIES 
		
	1ST TABLE  : 
		INTERVIEW_DATE 		STAFF		ROOM NO 
		13TH MAY 2021		SUNIL		C101
		13TH MAY 2021		NIKHIL		C102
		1ST JULY 2021		SUNIL		C102

			ALL ABOUT YOUR NORMALIZATIO CONCEPT 
				
	==============================================================

**** 
2ND TOPIC WHICH WAS LEFT WAS ER DIAGRAMS :

	ER DIAGRAMS  : 

		ENTITY RELATIONSHIP DIAGRAM 
			
			ENTITY  : ALL YOUR TABLE TREATED AS AN ENTITY 
			
			
	ENTITY : 
			WILL BE DEIFINED IN THE RECTANGLE 
				
	
	2) ATTRIBUTE : 
		ATTRIBUTES ARE THE PROPERTIES OF THE ENTITY.
			BASICALLY IN OUR TERMS ALL THE COLUMNS ARE ATTRIBUTE 
		
		DEFINE THE ELLIPSES
					
			
		- COMPOSITE ATTRIBUTE   : 
			NAME  - FISRT_NAME AND LAST NAME 
		- MULTIVALUED 
			PERSON MAY HAVE MULTIPLE VALUES 
			DOUBLE ELLIPSES
			
		- DERIVED ATTRIBUTES 
			SOME OF THE COLUMNS ARE DERIVED FROM SOME OTHER COLUMN 
			
			AGE ----- > DOB
			
			AGE - DASHED ELLIPSE
				
	3) 
		RELARTIONSHIP 
			
			
			ONE TO ONE 
				
						EACH EMPLOYEE MUST HAVE A SIGNLE EMPLOYEE ID 
						
				EMPLOYEE RECORDS  ----RELATION SHIP --- EMPLOYEEID 
			
			ONE TO MANY 
					EMPLOYEE ENROLLED WITH MORE THE ONE COURSE 
					
					EMPLPOYEE  ---  
			
			MANY TO ONE
