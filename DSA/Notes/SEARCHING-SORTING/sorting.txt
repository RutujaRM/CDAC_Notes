BUbble Sort
========
3 1 5 2
to sort in  increasing order
bring samllest element to front in Each iteration 
of the element left
OR
bring largest at rear in each iteration 
of the element left
=====
Bubble Sort
for put element -> 0 to n- 2
for right -> n-1 to (put element  at -1)
if !(elem[left]  < elem[right])
->swap left and right elem
If(elem[right] < elem[left])
====
Bubble sort of (elements,n)//'n' number of values in 'elements'
/*Start by putting correct element at 1st position , 
  then 2nd position then 3rd position ,until(n-1)st position.Once we 
  put(n-1) elements at current position, 
  nth element will be at correct position automatically
*/
-for putElementAtPos -> 0 to ( n- 2) 
  //Start with last element until before the putElementAtPos  
  -for right -> (n -1) to (putElementAtPos -1)
  //Compare right and left element
  -left = right -1
  //If right element is smaller than left then swap them.
  -If element[right] < elementt[left] then
  -Swap left and right elements.
-Stop
===============
time complexity of bubble sort
O(n sq)

why should we use bubble sort?
stable sort that's why prefered .
bubble sort always garenty the order is maintained

=========================================
SESSION 11
============
Selection Sort

for put element -> 0 to n- 2
->Assume last elem is smallest
smallest elements = n-1
for i ->(n-2) down to 
  putElementAt
  ->if elem[i] < elem[smallest elem]
   =smallest elm=i
->Swap smallest element position and 
  putElementAt element
==============
time complexity of selection sort
O(n sq)
========================================
Insertion sort
=============
we have some elements in sorted order
insert the new element so that all elements remains sorted
initial sorted array
5 8 9 -> sorted elements
new elm -> 3
 5 8 9
new element 3 ro insert
5 8 - 9
5 - 8 9
- 5 8 9
3 5 8 9
==============
initial unsorted array 
3 5 1 2


insert 1 in [3] so that element 5 remain sorted
element to insert will be -> 1
1 3 5 2 p notes
element to insert -> 5
1 3 5 2 p notes
element to insert is 2
1 2 3 5 p notes
================
sudo code for insertion sort
coppaste later
