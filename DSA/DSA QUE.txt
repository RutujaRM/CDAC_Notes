QUE 01: 
Given a string S, remove consecutive duplicates from it recursively.
Sample Test case 1 :
aabccba
Sample Output 1 :
abcba
Sample Test case 2 :
xxxyyyzwwzzz
Sample Output 2 :
xyzwz



QUE 02: 
For a given string expression containing only round brackets or parentheses, check if they 
are balanced or not. Brackets are said to be balanced if the bracket which opens last, closes first.
Example: Expression: (()())
Since all the opening brackets have their corresponding closing brackets, we say it is balanced 
and hence the output will be, 'true'.You need to return a boolean value indicating whether the 
expression is balanced or not.
Note: The input expression will not contain spaces in between.
Sample Test case 1 :
(()()())
Sample Output 1 :
true
Sample Test case 2 :
()()(()
Sample Output 2 :
false


QUE 03:
Write a menu driven java program to design the linked list functionality as follows:
1. Create a linked list.
2. Reverse the linked list.
3. Eliminate duplicates from the list.
4. Check whether the given list is a palindrome or not.
