1. CallableStatement :
It is used when you want to use the database stored procedures. CallableStatement can accept runtime input parameters.




2. PreparedStatement :
It is used when you want to use SQL statements many times. The PreparedStatement interface accepts input parameters at runtime


1. Statement : 
It is used for accessing your database. Statement interface cannot accept parameters and useful when you are using static SQL statements at runtime. If you want to run SQL query only once then this interface is preferred over PreparedStatement. 


Differance :-
CallableStatement :- It is used when the stored procedures are to be executed,You can pass 3 types of parameter IN, OUT, INOUT.,Used to execute functions.,Performance is very high.Used to call the stored procedures.It extends PreparedStatement interface.No protocol is used for communication.


PreparedStatement :- It is used when SQL query is to be executed multiple times.,You can pass any type of parameters at runtime.Used for the queries which are to be executed multiple times,Performance is better than Statement,Used to execute dynamic SQL queries,It extends Statement Interface,Protocol is used for communication.


java.util.date contains both date and time. Whereas, java.sql.date contains only date.


 PreparedStatement in Java improves performance and also prevents from SQL injection.

 java.sql.Time contains only time. Whereas, java.sql.TimeStamp contains both time and date.

 CallableStatement is used in JDBC to call stored procedure from Java program.

setMaxRows(int i) method is used to limit the number of rows that the database returns from the query.

rollback() method is used to rollback the transaction. It will rollback all the changes made by the transaction.





 What are the major components of the JDBC?

DriverManager, Driver, Connection, Statement, and ResultSet



The JDBC thin driver is a pure Java driver. It is also known as Type-4 Driver. It is platform-independent so it does not require any additional Oracle software on the client-side. It communicates with the server using SQL *Net to access Oracle Database.

getConnection()

8) Which methods are required to load a database driver in JDBC?
registerDriver()
forName()

Statement

ResultSet, Statements, and then Connection



16) Which JDBC driver can be used in servlet and applet both?


 Type 3 driver follows the three-tier approach which is used to access the databases. The JDBC clients use standard network sockets to communicate with a middleware application server. In a Type 4 driver, a pure Java-based driver that communicates directly with the vendor's database through a socket connection.


 There are three types of ResultSet object:

TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY: This is the default type and the cursor can only move forward in the result set.
TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE: The cursor can move forward and backward, and the result set is not sensitive to changes made by others to the database after the result set was created.
TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE: The cursor can move forward and backward, and the result set is sensitive to changes made by others to the database after the result set was created.
Based on the concurrency there are two types of ResultSet object.

CONCUR_READ_ONLY: The ResultSet is read-only, this is the default concurrency type.
CONCUR_UPDATABLE: We can use the ResultSet update method to update the rows data.



What is blob in the following statement?

create table profilepic(photo blob);  
ans=data type


 Which data type is used to store files in the database table?
CLOB


 Which statement(s) is/ are true about transactions?
i. A transaction is a set of one or more SQL statements that make up a logical unit of work.

ii. A transaction ends with either a commit or a rollback, depending on whether there are any problems with data consistency or data concurrency.
iv. To avoid conflicts during a transaction, a DBMS uses locks, mechanisms for blocking access by others to the data that is being accessed by the transaction.


 JDBC API supports____________ and __________ architecture model for accessing the database.
Two-tier
Three-tier

how many statement objects can be created using a Connection?
ans=multiple

 Which of the following interface provides the commit() and rollback() methods?
Connection Interface


) Are ResultSets updateable?
Yes, but only if we indicate a concurrency strategy when executing the statement, and if the driver and database support this option.


Which of the following driver converts the JDBC calls into database-specific calls?
Native API-partly Java Driver (Type 2)


 DatabaseMetaData interface is used to get?
Comprehensive information about the database as a whole.

  									
												SERVLET 







How constructor can be used for a servlet?
 Initialization and Constructor function
:-We cannot declare constructors for interface in Java. This means we cannot enforce this requirement to any class which implements Servlet interface.
Also, Servlet requires ServletConfig object for initialization which is created by container.


ServletConfig object is created after the constructor is called and before init() is called. So, servlet init parameters cannot be accessed in the constructor.


Which of the following code retrieves the body of the request as binary data?
 DataInputStream data = request.getInputStream()

Common Gateway Interface (CGI)  .

The Common Gateway Interface (CGI) provides the middleware between WWW servers and external databases and information sources. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) defined the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) and also defined how a program interacts with a Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server. The Web server typically passes the form information to a small application program that processes the data and may send back a confirmation message. This process or convention for passing data back and forth between the server and the application is called the common gateway interface (CGI).
